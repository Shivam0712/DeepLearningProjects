## Deep Learning For Text Classification using Pytorch Lightning

### Text Classification:

Text classification tasks involves assigning tags/categories to free text based on the type of content it consists. Text classification is fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications extends to sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.

### Pytorch Lightning:

Pytorch Lightning is a very lightweight wrapper on PyTorch. It provides a framework to standardize research codes and is recommnded by NeurIPS Conference for an easy reproducibile structure for research works.

You can find the instruction for installation and use of Pytorch Lighning [here](https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning).

### Implemented Architectures:
 In this project we try to build the following elementary Deep Learning architecture for text classification:
