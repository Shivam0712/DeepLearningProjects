# DeepLearningProjects

In this repository you will find a series of projects/notebooks using Deep Learning to solve problems from different fields.

## DeepLearning_for_TextClassfication
Text classification is extensively used in industry today for sentiment analysis. In this project we build different type of fundamental deep learning architectures such as DNN, CNN, RNN & RCNN using **Pytroch Lightning**.
**Pytorch Lightning** is a very lightweight wrapper on PyTorch. It provides a framework to standardize research codes and is recommnded by NeurIPS Conference.
