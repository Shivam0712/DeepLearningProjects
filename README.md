# DeepLearningProjects

The exponential growth in the number of complex datasets every year requires more enhancement in machine learning methods to provide robust and accurate data classification. Lately, deep learning approaches are achieving better results compared to previous machine learning algorithms on tasks like image classification, natural language processing, face recognition, etc. The success of these deep learning algorithms relies on their capacity to model complex and non-linear relationships within the data. In this repository you will find a series of projects/notebooks using Deep Learning to solve problems from different fields.

## DeepLearning_for_TextClassfication
Text classification is extensively used in industry today for sentiment analysis. In this project we build different type of fundamental deep learning architectures such as DNN, CNN, RNN & RCNN using **Pytroch Lightning**.

**Pytorch Lightning** is a very lightweight wrapper on PyTorch. It provides a framework to standardize research codes and is recommnded by NeurIPS Conference.
