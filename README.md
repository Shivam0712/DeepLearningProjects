# DeepLearningProjects

The exponential growth in the number of complex datasets every year requires more enhancement in machine learning methods to provide robust and accurate data classification. Lately, deep learning approaches are achieving better results compared to previous machine learning algorithms on tasks like image classification, natural language processing, face recognition, etc. The success of these deep learning algorithms relies on their capacity to model complex and non-linear relationships within the data. In this repository you will find a series of projects/notebooks using Deep Learning to solve problems from different fields.

## DeepLearning_for_TextClassfication
Text classification is extensively used in industry today for sentiment analysis. In this project we build different type of fundamental deep learning architectures such as DNN, CNN, RNN & RCNN using **Pytroch Lightning**.

**Pytorch Lightning** is a very lightweight wrapper on PyTorch. It provides a framework to standardize research codes and is recommnded by NeurIPS Conference.

## SemiSupervisedLearning_for_ImageClassification
The application of deep learning is rapidly growing in the field of computer vision and is helping in building robust classification and identification models. However, to witness this superior performance a large amount of human labelled dataset is required,  a luxury that is not available across all domains. To counter this problem the possible solutions are **Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation, & Semi-Supervised Learning.**

In Semi-Supervised learning, prior to the training of the network on actual image classification task, we train the network on an arbitary task to learn robust low level features. this helps to improve models performance in case of low number of labelled training image samples.
